# Least-cost-corridor-and-path-analysis
This tool generates a raster displaying least-cost corridors and a polyline shapefile illustrating least-cost paths between pairs of input points. Instead of relying on a single least-cost path (LCP) that may oversimplify landscape processes, it adopts categories of cost paths, encompassing slightly costlier alternatives. This approach enables more accurate depiction of habitat heterogeneity and its influence on dispersal. You can classify the most affordable paths into three categories for each comparison, and the tool also produces a raster highlighting the frequency of traversed LCPs through a density analysis.
