# Least-cost-corridor-and-path-analysis
This tool creates a raster of least-cost corridors and a polyline shapefile of least-cost paths between pair-wise combinations of input points. Often a single LCP between sites oversimplifies landscape processes. By using categories of cost paths that include paths with slightly more costly path lengths (relative to the LCP), you can better depict habitat heterogeneity and its varying roles in dispersal. For each comparison you can classify the lowest cost paths into three categories. Lastly, a density analysis will produce a raster depicting the frequency that LCPs traverse the same path.
